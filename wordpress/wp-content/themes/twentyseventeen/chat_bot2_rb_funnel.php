			<img src="../../assets/images/wordpress-cms-img1.jpg" align="WP CMS" class="wp_cms_img">

			<ul>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> WordPress is thee most <strong>POWERFUL</strong> content management system on the planet today!</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> I myself still use WordPress today and on average earn around <strong>R8000</strong> per project done.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The <strong>BEST</strong> part about WordPress is that it's all click-of-a-button stuff. So you don't need to be tech-savvy or know anything about websites and CMS's to get started!</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> From personal websites, to selling your own products via an eCommerce website, I teach you everything you need to know on how to set it all up.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> You can go ahead confidently and <strong>QUICKLY</strong> setup a website, eCommerce store, payment systems etc...for business, other people or clients you may have.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> <u>BTW...<strong>NO NEED</strong></u> to travel to any building or office to do all this. Work from the comfort of your <strong>OWN HOME!</strong> Isn't that cool?!</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="wait-theres-more">
				<i class="fa fa-check"></i> But Wait...there's <strong>MORE!</strong>. Yes, did you think that is all I will be giving you? Not a chance! I am a generous guy and want to <u><strong>HELP YOU SUCCEED!</strong></u> Giving away products is in my nature, because well...that's the way I roll.
			</p>

			<p><img src="../../assets/images/web-hosting3.jpg" align="Hosting"></p>
			<ul>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Part of the content you will get for <strong>FREE</strong> includes learning how to register your own website URL / web address (technically called a domain).</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> This fits in beautifully with the WordPress course material above as it gives you the ability to deliver / offer a more complete package when doing this for a potential customer. You will be a one-stop shop for domain registration and wordpress website building!</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> You will also learn how to use file server tools to upload your own web files.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ultimately the hosting videos is a <strong><u>PERFECT FOIL</u></strong> for the wordpress course material you will learn.</li>

				<span class="header-testim">Bridgette Is Pretty Happy With Her Results Thus Far</span>
				<img src="../../assets/images/testimonial-img2.jpg" alt="test 1" class="test-img-1" />
				<p>Up until seeing this course I had never ever built a website before! I always had some local product which I sold in my area but being able to quickly put together an eCommerce store was something beautiful! I could manage my products in a safe and secure Word Press system and best of all, I could access the system anywhere I went. This course is Really good and <strong>VERY</strong> refreshing! Thank you so much EasyWebLearning team and in particular, Julian! You've really added much needed technical value to my life and my products!</p>

				<img src="../../assets/images/testimonial-img1.jpg" alt="test 1" class="test-img-2" />
				<span class="header-testim">Mark Excelled Beyond The FREE course</span>
				<p>What I really needed was online marketing direction and that's what I got when I signed up for the <u>Marketing-College ("Marketing-C") membership</u>. Receiving the WordPress and Hosting videos was simply an <strong>INSANELY-GOOD BONUS!</strong> I was able to learn how to <u>SUCCESSFULLY</u> market my offline products online and in the process learn to put together my own eCommerce website to sell them.</p>
				<p>Again, the WordPress and Hosting course material is <u>GREAT, <strong>BUT</strong></u>...I would <u>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</u> signing up for the <strong>Entire Marketing-C business membership suite</strong>, because you will be able to move from a couple of thousand Rand in sales and profit...to 100's of Thousands of Rands within a matter of months. I'm stoked with my results and would highly recommend the entire course for <strong>MAXIMUM</strong> results and <strong>MAXIMUM</strong> profits. Thank you Julian and team</p>

				<span class="header-testim">Macy's story</span>
				<p>As a stay-at-home mom I was looking for ways to earn some extra income. I had read up on Online Marketing and then stumbled upon the EasyWebLearning course material.</p>
				<p>How thankful I am for getting here because within <u>5 months</u> I was not only able to come up with a good product, but was able to market these products online and earn my first <strong>$1000</strong> passively.  Initially I started out with the Wordpress course material and it was amazing! But afterwards, when I finally signed up for the entire Marketing membership I really found the TRUE POWER of this course as a whole, because there Julian taught me step-by-step, how to get a <u>successfull online marketing strategy going</u> and ultimately how to sell my products online. Currently I am passively earning over <strong>$4000</strong> per month and I have the Marketing, Facebook business tool software, Wordpress and hosting videos to thank for that. Thank you EWL team...you guys <strong>ROCK!</strong></p>

				<strong>So What's The Catch?</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="fontS24">
				I'm giving you this gift as a bribe, to test drive my new Funnel University newsletter and membership site.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">Why would I do this?</p> 
			<img src="../../assets/images/wordpress-hosting-img1.jpg" alt="WP Hosting" class="wp-mark-side-img">
			<p class="fontS24">Well, there are actually a few reasons...</p>
			<p class="fontS24">1. It's my way of saying thank you for being a dedicated subscriber.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">2. Because (unlike other "gurus") I don't make all of my money teaching others how to make money (I actually run real businesses online selling software, supplements, physical products and more)... so because of that, it doesn't hurt me to share with you my best stuff.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">3. I get another one of my products in your hands, and when you see how awesome it is, it should get you excited to buy other stuff from me in the future. The more money I can make you now, the more likely you are to join my $25k Inner Circle program in the future.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">4. I'm kinda a show off... I'm not going to lie. I'm sick of people throwing out conversion numbers and their stats without any real proof to back it up. I think 99% of what is said online is complete BS... so I thought it would be a breath of fresh air to publish the TRUTH, show the actual stats and #'s behind what we do, and well... honestly, I just want you to think I'm cool. :)</p>
			<p class="existing-customers-header">
				<strong>Why Time Is Of The Essence...</strong>
			</p>
			<img src="../../assets/images/time-img1.png" alt="Time" class="time-img">			
			<p class="fontS24">
			This is a limited offer, but even inside of that, there is REAL scarcity that you need to be aware of...</p>
			<p class="fontS24"><strong>1st) For my <u>Full ONCE-OFF Membership College Package</u></strong> I have only managed to source <strong>1000</strong> discount vouchers. Unfortunately I cannot source more at this point in time, so it will be treated as a first-come first-serve basis.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">2nd) If you don't lock in your membership NOW while this page is live... you'll NEVER be able to get back to this private members area.</p>
			<p class="fontS24"><strong>3rd) This charter pricing (26% - 75% discount) AND the trial offer will not last forever.</strong> We are selling out memberships fast, and as soon as we hit our target number, we will be raising the prices back to full price. It's simple supply and demand and it's happening here in real time.</p>
			<p class="fontS24">So NOW is the time to lock in your membership.</p>				
			</p>
			<p class="existing-customers-header">
				<strong>Here's What To Do Next...</strong>
			</p>
			<p>From here it's just finalizing the details. Click on the button below, pick what subscription plan you want to be on, and we can finally get started!</p>
			<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this letter and watching the video. I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
